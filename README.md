# EcoSofia: Making Sofia the Smartest Green City in Europe

Hey there, eco-warrior! üëã Welcome to the EcoSofia project. We're on a mission to turn Sofia into a sustainable urban paradise, and we're using some seriously cool tech to do it.

## What's This All About?

Imagine a city where every decision about urban development is backed by AI, where citizens have a real say in making their neighborhoods greener, and where being eco-friendly earns you rewards. That's what we're building with EcoSofia.

We're mashing up blockchain, AI, and a dash of civic enthusiasm to create a platform that's going to revolutionize how Sofia (and maybe one day, other cities) approaches sustainability.

## The Cool Stuff We're Using

- **Chainbase**: Our AI brain that crunches urban data and spits out eco-wisdom
- **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**: The blockchain backbone of our operation
- **iExec and zkVerify**: For when you want to vote on that new park, but don't want your nosy neighbor to know
- **Sui's Walrus**: Where we store all our brilliant green ideas
- **Blocksense**: Our eyes and ears on the ground, feeding us real-time environmental data
- **PING42**: Our very own eco-currency (no, you can't mine it by leaving your computer on 24/7)
- **SEEBLOCKS**: Keeping us in line with fancy ISO standards

## What Can You Do Here?

1. **Propose a Green Initiative**: Got an idea for a community garden? A solar-powered unicycle sharing system? Bring it on!
2. **Vote on Projects**: Like democracy, but for trees and stuff.
3. **Earn PING42 Tokens**: Get rewarded for not turning Sofia into a concrete jungle.
4. **Analyze Environmental Impact**: Use our AI to check if your brilliant idea won't accidentally summon Godzilla.
5. **Track Real-time Eco Data**: Air quality, energy usage, how many times the mayor used their bike this week - it's all here.
